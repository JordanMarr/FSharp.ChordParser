# FSharp.ChordParser

I created this for my dad to allow him to transpose chords and change lyrics to uppercase (and it was also a great opportunity for me to learn FParsec).

## Fabulous UI

## Command line syntax:
- ChordParser `{path to .txt file}`
- ChordParser `{path to .txt file} {transpose semitones (int)} {preferred accidental (#|b)}`

To try it out against the sample txt file (Song.txt), just run the app; it will output "Song ChordParser.txt".
